# Working with Functions

The database operations team has created a relational database named **world** containing three tables: city, 
country, and countrylanguage. Based on specific use cases in the lab exercise, I write a few queries 
using database functions with the **SELECT** statement and **WHERE** clause.

![Working with Function Overview](./images/lab05-architecture.png)

## Task 1: Connect to the Command Host
I connect to the Command Host EC2 instance containing a database client via the Session Manager tab.
```bash
sudo su
cd /home/ec2-user/
mysql -u root --password='re:St@rt!9'
```

## Task 2: Query the world database
I query the **world** database using various SELECT statements and database functions. 
I use a function to process and manipulate data in a query.

```sql
-- review the table schema, data, and number of rows in the country table
SELECT * FROM world.country;             -- 239 rows

-- aggregate data from all records in the country table
SELECT sum(Population), avg(Population), max(Population), min(Population), count(Population) FROM world.country;
-- SUM() adds all the population values together.
-- AVG() generates an average across all the population values.
-- MAX() finds the row with the highest population value.
-- MIN() finds the row with the lowest population value.
-- COUNT() finds the number of rows with a population value.
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+
| sum(Population) | avg(Population) | max(Population) | min(Population) | count(Population) |
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------------+

SELECT Region, substring_index(Region, " ", 1) FROM world.country;

34 rows in set (0.001 sec)

-- regions that have fewer than 10 characters in their names
SELECT DISTINCT Region FROM world.country WHERE LENGTH(TRIM(Region)) < 10;

| Caribbean |
| Polynesia |
| Melanesia |

3 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

## Challenge
Query the country table to return a set of records based on the following requirement:

Write a query to return rows that have Micronesian/Caribbean as the name in the region column. 
The output should split the region as Micronesia and Caribbean into two separate columns: one named Region Name 1 and one named Region Name 2.

```sql
SELECT Name,
  substring_index(Region, "/", 1) as "Region Name 1",
  substring_index(region, "/", -1) as "Region Name 2"
  FROM world.country
  WHERE Region = "Micronesia/Caribbean";
+--------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+
| Name                                 | Region Name 1 | Region Name 2 |
+--------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+
| United States Minor Outlying Islands | Micronesia    | Caribbean     |
+--------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.000 sec)
```
